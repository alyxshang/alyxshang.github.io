# Hello there!

Hi, my name is Alex or Alyx. I have been writing code for 13 years and I am comfortable in multiple programming languages. This website is my personal website and serves as a showcase for different projects I have worked on and will work on. This site is powered by Mandy, one of my biggest projects. You can find out more about Mandy [here](https://github.com/alyxshang/mandy).

***Sincerely,***
***Alex***
